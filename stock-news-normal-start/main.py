# TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

# TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

# TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
